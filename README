# Knitting Patterns for HTML5 #

The purpose of this project is to provide client-side developers with a set of basic pages against which they can test their stylesheets.

Pattern1 simply contains a list of text, list, table and form tags against which styling can be applied.

Further patterns will contain more real-world pages that stylesheets might need to take into account; white spacing, long words, code samples and the like.

Contributions of new patterns and improvements on existing ones are welcome.
